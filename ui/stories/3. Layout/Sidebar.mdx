# Sidebar layout
- The sidebar layout is designed to cater for the behaviour of the narrower of two adjacent elements.
- An example of its usage can be found in the [page with sidebar](/story/layout-page--page-sidebar) layout.
- Also see [Every Layout's sidebar](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/sidebar/) for a detailed explanation of the Flex behaviour.

    <Story id="layout-sidebar--sidebar" />

## With right sidebar
- Please note the source order in the HTML. The sidebar comes **after** the main content, to preserve natural tab sequence for keyboard users.
