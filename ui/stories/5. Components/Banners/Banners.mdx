# Banners.
- Banners are essentially variations of [card](/docs/components-cards--docs) components. As such, only banners with fullwidth images or specific overlay styles are documented here.
- Please see [responsive image](/docs/components-images--docs) component for a description of banner image markup and behaviour.
- The `banner__content` container uses the [stack layout](/docs/layout-stack--docs) to manage spacing between all its children.

## Fullwidth banner with text overlay
<Canvas of={Banners.FullwidthBanner} />

## Fullwidth banner with image overlay mask
- e.g. Gradient overlay to make text content more readable.

<Canvas of={Banners.FullwidthBannerOverlay} />
