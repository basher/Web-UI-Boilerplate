# Disclosure
- Use this component when [accordion](/story/components-accordion--accordion) or [tabs](/story/components-tabs--tabs) components cannot be used.
- See the [ARIA disclosure pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/).

## Accessibility considerations
- By adding the `data-disclosure-escape-key` attribute to the HTML, the `ESC` key can be used to hide the content.
- Similarly, the `data-disclosure-click-outside` attribute hides the content when clicking anywhere outside the content.
