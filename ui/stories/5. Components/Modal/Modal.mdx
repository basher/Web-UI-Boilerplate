# Modal
- Uses the native HTML `<dialog>` element. See [dialog](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) docs on MDN.

<Canvas of={Modal.Modal} />

## Accessibility considerations
- There are ongoing discussions about the [initial focus behaviour](https://github.com/whatwg/html/wiki/dialog--initial-focus,-a-proposal) for `<dialog>`.
    - Keyboard `focus` is currently being set on the `data-content` using `tabindex="-1"` to ensure that content gets announced first, before the `data-close` button.
- When modal is closed using the native `close()` method, focus is set back to the button that opened the modal (default browser behaviour).
- Modal can be closed by clicking the <kbd>esc</kbd> key (default browser behaviour), or by clicking outside the modal (JavaScript enhancement).

## Required and optional HTML  or `data-` attributes

Attribute | Behaviour
--- | ---
`data-open` | Required. Button that opens the modal dialog.
`data-close` | Required. Button(s) that close the modal dialog.
`data-content` | Required. Identifies the modal dialog content.
