# Modal
- Uses the native HTML `<dialog>` element. See [dialog](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) docs on MDN.

## Accessibility considerations
- There are ongoing discussions about the [initial focus behaviour](https://github.com/whatwg/html/wiki/dialog--initial-focus,-a-proposal) for `<dialog>`.
    - Keyboard `focus` is currently being set on the `data-modal-content` using `tabindex="-1"` to ensure that content gets announced first, before the `close` button.
- When modal is closed, focus is set back to the button that opened the modal.
- Modal can be closed with the `ESC` key (default browser behaviour), and by clicking outside the modal (JavaScript enhancement).
