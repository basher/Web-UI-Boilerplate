# Modal
- Uses the native HTML `<dialog>` element. See [dialog](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) docs on MDN.
- The button that opens the modal uses the [Invoker Commands API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API#creating_declarative_dialogs).
- No JavaScript is required, except for non-supporting browsers (which use this [polyfill](https://github.com/keithamus/invokers-polyfill/)).
- This boilerplate also includes an example of a [`<webui-modal>`](/docs/web-components-or-custom-elements-webui-modal--docs) Web Component.

## Accessibility considerations
- There are ongoing discussions about the [initial focus behaviour](https://github.com/whatwg/html/wiki/dialog--initial-focus,-a-proposal) for `<dialog>`.
    - Keyboard `focus` is currently being set on the first focusable element in the modal.
- Closing the modal is handled by the [closedby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/dialog#closedby) attribute on the `<dialog>`, and focus is set on the button that invoked the modal.

## Required and optional HTML attributes

Attribute | Behaviour
--- | ---
`command` | Required. Button that opens the modal dialog.
`commandfor` | Required. Button that opens the modal dialog. This is a reference to the modal's `id`.
`id` | Required. Modal dialog, which must match `commandfor` on the invoking button.
`command` | Optional. Button that closes the modal dialog.
`commandfor` | Optional. Button that closes the modal dialog. This is a reference to the modal's `id`.
