# Image gallery
- Uses a simple [grid list layout](/story/layout-grid--grid-list) to arrange the image thumbnails.
- Without JavaScript, clicking on thumbnails opens large images in the browser window.
- With JavaScript enabled, the large images are shown in a [modal dialog](/story/components-modal--modal).

> Please note: For brevity, the large images only have a subset of [responsive image](/story/components-images--responsive-image) `<source>` markup.

## TODO
- Consider refactoring modal component to allow 1 single modal instance to be opened by multiple triggers?
- Consider showing the large images in a carousel or slider?
