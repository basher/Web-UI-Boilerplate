# Image gallery
- This component uses the [modal](/docs/components-modal--docs) component to create a simple "lightbox".
- The image thumbnails are arranged with a simple [grid list layout](/story/layout-grid--grid-list).

> Please note: For brevity, the large images only have a subset of the [responsive image](/docs/components-images--docs) `<source>` markup in the `<picture>` element.
