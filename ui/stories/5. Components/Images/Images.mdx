# Images

## Responsive and performance considerations
- Responsive images use the HTML `<picture>` element.
- The image `media` queries are based on the CSS breakpoint values.
- Images are [lazy loaded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading), but be aware of [not lazy loading images above the fold](https://web.dev/lazy-loading-best-practices/).
-  Images have [explicit height & width](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/setting-height-width-images-important-again/) declared in the HTML.

## Fixed size images
- If just 1 image size is needed, still use the `<picture>` element.
- This allows **next-gen** images to be served - e.g. `type="image/webp"`.
