# Responsive media (iframes, videos, etc)
- The `iframe` & `video` examples use standard Google Maps & YouTube `embed` code.
- Responsive media components can be nested inside other components - e.g. `card` or `grid`.
- A default aspect ratio for *"media"* has been defined in the CSS. This can be overridden to match the natural aspect ratio of the media by adding an inline style to the parent `responsive-media` container:
```
style="--media-aspect-ratio: 21/9;"
```

<Canvas of={ResponsiveMedia.ResponsiveIframe} />

## Accessibility considerations
- `<iframe>` should have a non-empty `title` attribute.

## Performance considerations
- Native [lazy-loaded iframes](https://web.dev/iframe-lazy-loading/) are now supported in modern browsers.
- See the [`<webui-video-player>`](/docs/web-components-or-custom-elements-webui-video-player--docs) Web Component for a real use case, with a fallback for older browsers.
