# Cards
- Card components use the [flex layout](/docs/layout-flex--docs).
- The `card__content` container uses the [stack layout](/docs/layout-stack--docs) to manage spacing between all its children.
- The `card__media` container is marked up as a `<figure>`, and can contain `<picture>`, `<video>`, `<iframe>`, etc.
- By default, cards have no visual treatment such as background colour, border, shadow, etc. Apply visual styles using the [skin](/docs/components-skin--docs) component.
- Also see [Inclusive Components cards](https://inclusive-components.design/cards/).

## Default card
- The default card component is marked up as an `<article>`, and should therefore contain a heading with the appropriate level.
- Uses `<picture>` with a single fixed size image, whose orientation can be `top`, `bottom`, `left` or `right`.

## Fullwidth card
- This card uses `<picture>` so that the image size can be optimised at different breakpoints.
- It's a variant of `card--media-inline`.

<Controls of={Cards.FullwidthCard} />

## Clickable card
- This card replaces `<article>` with an `<a>`.

### Accessibility considerations
- The image has an empty `alt` attribute.
- Minimise the amount of text, as it will all be read out as link text by assistive technologies.

### Alternative approach
- Use JavaScript to make a standard card clickable. See [`<webui-make-clickable>`](/docs/web-components-or-custom-elements-webui-make-clickable--docs) Web Component.

## Cards in a grid
- It's a good idea to set a `max-width` on the `grid-template-columns` to match the size of the card (which will probably be determined by the image size).
- This is achieved via the `card-grid` override CSS classname.

## Cards in a carousel
- It's a good idea to set the `--slide-min-width` on the slides to match the size of the card.
- This is achieved via the `card-carousel` override CSS classname.

## TODO
- Add cards with multiple CTAs. Might need JS to intercept click events?
- Add media/container queries to modify fullwidth gap & content width?
