# Navigation
- All navigation components use the native HTML `<nav>` element, with 1 or more lists of anchors/links.

## Accessibility and responsive behaviour considerations
- The navigation has a unique `id` so it can be directly accessed via [skiplinks](/docs/components-skiplinks--docs).
- The **current/active** page link is identified by [aria-current](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-current).
- Don't use [ARIA menu role](https://adrianroselli.com/2017/10/dont-use-aria-menu-roles-for-site-nav.html) for site navigation. Also see [Inclusive Components menus](https://inclusive-components.design/menus-menu-buttons/).
- Responsive behaviour can be handled in a number of ways:
    - For simplicity, use `flex-wrap` to make the primary navigation items wrap onto a new row when space is limited.
    - And/or add `overflow-x: auto` to the parent container to allow horizontal scrolling.
    - And/or add `media` or `container` queries to stack the navigation vertically when space is limited.
    - And/or use the hamburger navigaton pattern(s), as shown further down.
    - And/or use JavaScript to handle *"fly-in"* or *"slide-in/out"* behaviour.

## Hamburger (with simple navigation)
- Uses the [`<webui-disclosure>`](/docs/web-components-or-custom-elements-webui-disclosure--docs) Web Component to show/hide the navigation.
- Clicking the <kbd>esc</kbd> key or clicking outside the navigation both close the hamburger navigation.
- The disclosure button is placed **inside** the navigation region, allowing screen reader users who move to the `<nav>` using a shortcut to access the button directly.

## Disclosure navigation (with top-level links and dropdown menus)
- Uses the [`<webui-disclosure>`](/docs/web-components-or-custom-elements-webui-disclosure--docs) Web Component to show/hide the dropdowns via a `<button>` click, not CSS `:hover`.
- Clicking the <kbd>esc</kbd> key and clicking outside the dropdown both close the dropdown.
- See the [ARIA APG navigation pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-navigation-hybrid/) and [Adrian Roselli's article](https://adrianroselli.com/2019/06/link-disclosure-widget-navigation.html) for more details.
- Also see this article that explains why [native HTML details/summary should not be used for navigation disclosure](https://melsumner.github.io/details-as-a-menu).
