## Predictive search (with dynamic results from API)
- When JavaScript is enabled, form submit is disabled and submit button is hidden.

### Accessibility considerations
- Dynamic search results are displayed in an [aria-live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions).
