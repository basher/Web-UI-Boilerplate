# Accordion
- Uses the native HTML `<details>`|`<summary>` elements.

## Accessibility considerations
- There are several articles cautioning against using `<details>`|`<summary>` for accordions. For example:
    - [Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me//blog/2022/09/12/details-summary.html).
    - [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/2019/12/why-details-is-not-an-accordion/).
- An alternative approach is to use the [disclosure](/story/components-disclosure--disclosure) component.
