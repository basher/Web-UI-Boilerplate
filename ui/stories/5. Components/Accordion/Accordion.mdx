# Accordion
- Uses the native HTML `<details>`|`<summary>` elements.
- The `::details-content` pseudo-element is used to animate the accordion opening & closing.

<Canvas of={Accordion.Accordion} />

## Accessibility considerations
- There are several articles cautioning against using `<details>`|`<summary>` for accordions. For example:
    - [Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me//blog/2022/09/12/details-summary.html).
    - [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/2019/12/why-details-is-not-an-accordion/).
- An alternative approach is to use the [`<webui-disclosure>`](/docs/web-components-or-custom-elements-webui-disclosure--docs) Web Component.

## Browser compatibility
<baseline-status featureId="details-content"></baseline-status>

## Exclusive accordion
Uses the `name` attribute on `<details>` elements to create an exclusive accordion, where only one section can be open at a time.
<Canvas of={Accordion.AccordionExclusive} />

## With custom icon
<Canvas of={Accordion.AccordionCustomIcon} />
