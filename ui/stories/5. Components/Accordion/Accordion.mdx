import { Meta, Canvas } from '@storybook/blocks';
import * as Accordion from './Accordion.stories';

<Meta of={Accordion} />

# Accordion
- Uses the native HTML `<details>`|`<summary>` elements.

<Canvas of={Accordion.Accordion} />

## Accessibility considerations
- There are several articles cautioning against using `<details>`|`<summary>` for accordions. For example:
    - [Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me//blog/2022/09/12/details-summary.html).
    - [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/2019/12/why-details-is-not-an-accordion/).
- An alternative approach is to use the [`<webui-disclosure>`](/docs/web-components-or-custom-elements-webui-disclosure--docs) Web Component.

## With custom icon
<Canvas of={Accordion.AccordionCustomIcon} />
