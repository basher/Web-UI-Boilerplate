# Tabs

## Accessibility and responsive behaviour considerations
- Rather than [Stacking tabs vertically on narrow viewports](https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/#responsivedesign), a simple horizontal overflow scrolling solution is used instead to make tabs responsive.
- Tabs are fully keyboard accessible:
    - Use `TAB | SHIFT TAB` key to focus on currently selected tab, and traverse the content inside the tab.
    - Use `RIGHT` arrow key to focus on next tab.
    - Use `LEFT` arrow key to focus on previous tab.
    - Use `HOME | END` key to focus on first or last tab.
- See the [ARIA APG patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabpanel/) and [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/) examples.
