# Forms

## Accessibility considerations
- All form fields need a `<label>`, which is explicitly associated with the relevant field with `for | id` attribute pairs.
- Additionally, any "grouped" form fields (e.g. `<input type="radio">`) should be enclosed in a `<fieldset>` with an appropriate `<legend>` to provide additional context for screen readers.

## Native HTML5 browser validation
- For example, using `:valid`, `:invalid` and `:required` CSS pseudo classes.
- Adding a `title` attribute to a form field can improve the default browser validation error message.

## JavaScript validation
- [Better approach to form validation](https://adamsilver.io/blog/the-problem-with-live-validation-and-what-to-do-instead/) - using form `submit` rather than live inline validation.
- Using the [Constraint Validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#validating_forms_using_javascript).
