# Forms

## Accessibility considerations & form validation
- All form fields need a `<label>`, which is explicitly associated with the relevant field with `for | id` attribute pairs.
- Additionally, any "grouped" form fields (e.g. `<input type="radio">`) should be enclosed in a `<fieldset>` with an appropriate `<legend>` to provide additional context for screen readers.
- **Native HTML5 browser validation** is being used, with no additional client-side validation JavaScript.
    - For example, `:valid`, `:invalid` and `:required` pseudo classes.

### TODO
- Add JavaScript validation.
