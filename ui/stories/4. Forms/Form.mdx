# Forms

## Accessibility considerations & form validation
- All form fields need a `<label>`, which is explicitly associated with the relevant field with `for | id` attribute pairs.
- Additionally, any "grouped" form fields (e.g. `<input type="radio">`) should be enclosed in a `<fieldset>` with an appropriate `<legend>` to provide additional context for screen readers.

## Native HTML5 browser validation
- For example, `:valid`, `:invalid` and `:required` pseudo classes.
