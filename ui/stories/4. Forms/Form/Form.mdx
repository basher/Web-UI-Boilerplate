# Forms

## Accessibility considerations
- All form fields need a `<label>`, which is explicitly associated with the relevant field with `for | id` attribute pairs.
- Additionally, any "grouped" form fields (e.g. `<input type="radio">`) should be enclosed in a `<fieldset>` with an appropriate `<legend>` to provide additional context for screen readers.
- Invalid fields should be identified with `aria-invalid="true"` and `aria-describedby` which references the `id` of appropriate error text.

## Native HTML5 browser validation
- Using `:valid`, `:invalid` and `:required` CSS pseudo classes.
- Adding a `title` attribute to a form field can improve the default browser validation error message.

## Server-side validation
- It can be a good idea to add an additional error summary block to list all the form errors, with anchors to each field.

## JavaScript validation
- See a [better approach to form validation](https://adamsilver.io/blog/the-problem-with-live-validation-and-what-to-do-instead/) that uses form `submit` rather than live inline validation.
- Uses the [Constraint Validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#validating_forms_using_javascript).
