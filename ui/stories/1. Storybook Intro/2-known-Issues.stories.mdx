# Known Storybook issues

## 1. Component JavaScript doesn't fire in `docs` mode.
That's actually OK, as it shows what is rendered if JavaScript was disabled or broken.

## 2. Storybook fires `DOMContentLoaded` event [more than once](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/15753).
To mitigate this, a `custom Storybook event` is fired in `.storybook\preview-head.html`. This event is listened for in `src/javascript/index.ts` in order to re-initialise the JavaScript.

If JavaScript appears not to be working correctly, switch to `docs` mode then back to `canvas` mode.

## 3. Unable to migrate to Storybook V7
I have raised an [issue regarding MDX support with Storybook/HTML](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/22249).
