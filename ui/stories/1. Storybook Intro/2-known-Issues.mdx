# Known Storybook issues

## 1. Component JavaScript doesn't always fire in `docs` mode.
That's actually OK, as it shows what is rendered if JavaScript is disabled or broken.

## 2. Storybook fires `DOMContentLoaded` event more than once.
See [this issue on Github](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/15753).

To mitigate this, a `custom Storybook event` is fired in `.storybook\preview-head.html`. This event is handled in `src/javascript/index.ts` in order to re-initialise the JavaScript modules for some of the components.

If JavaScript appears not to be working correctly, open the `docs` page then go back to `story` page.
