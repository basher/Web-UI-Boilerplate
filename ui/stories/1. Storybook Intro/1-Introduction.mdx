# Web UI Boilerplate Storybook
This is an accessible UI boilerplate and component library for websites & webapps.

It comprises
- global design system tokens - colours, typography, icons
- fully functioning UI components and layouts, which can be optionally configured using Storybook's `controls` addon to demonstrate variations in behaviour & layout
- useful utilities & helpers

```
No external frameworks have been harmed in the making of this boilerplate!
No React. No Vue. No CSS-in-JS. No Tailwind.
Just plain vanilla code. ðŸ˜œ
```

## Code authoring guidelines & accessibility
- All UI components are authored with **semantic HTML5** markup.
- Some components are **progressively enhanced** with JavaScript and `WAI-ARIA` as appropriate. <sup>1</sup>
- The HTML markup uses the `BEM` methodology to provide CSS namespacing.
- Visual styling is minimal & unopinionated.
- The CSS is authored with as little code as necessary, making full use of the CSS cascade and inheritance.
- [View source code on Github](https://github.com/basher/Web-UI-Boilerplate).

> <sup>1</sup>
> The JavaScript-enhanced components have been authored as [HTML Web Components](/docs/web-components-or-custom-elements-using-web-components--docs), also known as `custom elements`.

### Accessibility testing
Storybook comes with 2 default accessibility testing tools:
- `Accessibility addon`. This is in the Storybook `addons` toolbar, and is built on the same [AxeCore API](https://www.deque.com/axe/) that Lighthouse uses.
- `Vision simulator`. This is in the main Storybook toolbar at the top of each story page.
