# Web UI Boilerplate Storybook
This UI boilerplate comprises:
- Global design system tokens, such as colours, typography, icons.
- Fully functioning UI components and layouts, which can be optionally configured using Storybook's `controls` addon to demonstrate variations in behaviour & layout.
- Utilities & helpers.

```
No external frameworks have been harmed in the making of this boilerplate!
No React. No Vue. No CSS-in-JS. No Tailwind.
Just plain vanilla code. ðŸ˜œ
```

## Code authoring guidelines & accessibility
- All UI components are authored with **semantic HTML5** markup, which is **progressively enhanced** with JavaScript and `WAI-ARIA` as appropriate.
- The HTML markup uses the `BEM` methodology to provide CSS namespacing.
- Visual styling is minimal & unopinionated.
- The CSS is authored with as little code as necessary, making full use of the CSS cascade and inheritance.

### Accessibility testing
Storybook comes with 2 default accessibility testing tools:
- `Accessibility addon`. This is in the Storybook `addons` toolbar, and is built on the same [AxeCore API](https://www.deque.com/axe/) that Lighthouse uses.
- `Vision simulator`. This is in the main Storybook toolbar at the top of the page.

## Re-ordering stories in sidebar navigation
- All stories and docs are ordered according to the `storySort` configuration in `ui/.storybook/preview.js`.
