# Icons

## Accessibility considerations

- Accessible HTML markup for icons is based on these 3 articles:
    - [Accessible SVG icons with inline sprites](https://www.24a11y.com/2018/accessible-svg-icons-with-inline-sprites/).
    - [Accessible icon buttons](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/accessible-icon-buttons/).
    - [Contextually marking up accessible images and SVGs](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/05/22/contextual-images-svgs-and-a11y.html).
- The `<title>` element in decorative icons and icon-only buttons provides additional textual context on mouse `:hover`.
- Ensure `<title>` and/or `<span class="sr-only">` convey the correct meaning of the icon button or link.
- However, if the icon is purely decorative and there is visible text associated with it, there is no need for `<title>` attribute, and the `role="img"` should be replaced with `aria-hidden="true"`.

## Using external SVG sprites with `<use href=""/>"`

- The SVG sprite needs to be copied from the `src/images` folder to the `public` folder in order for it to be used in Storybook.

## Icon sizes

- The default icon size is `1em` so that it inherits the font size of its parent container.
- Selecting any of the available size variants will set a specific icon size in `rem` units.
