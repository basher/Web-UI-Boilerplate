# CSS utility classes
This boilerplate does not include CSS utility classes such as `color-primary` or `bg-secondary`, to avoid bloat. Instead, it provides a small set of utility classes for common layout and accessibility needs.

## assistive technologies
- `visually-hidden` visually hides content, but still make it available to assistive technologies.

<Canvas of={Utilities.ScreenReader} />

## Hide content
- `u-hidden` removes content from the DOM, using `display: none;`.
- Alternatively, use the HTML `hidden` attribute.

<Canvas of={Utilities.HideContent} />

## Center content
- `u-center` horizontally centers the content.

<Canvas of={Utilities.CenterContent} />
