import { Meta, Canvas } from '@storybook/blocks';

<Meta of={WebUIMakeClickable} />

# `<webui-make-clickable>`
- The entire Web Component is made clickable via JavaScript.

<Canvas of={WebUIMakeClickable.WebUIMakeClickable} />

## Accessibility considerations
- Based on [Inclusive Components cards](https://inclusive-components.design/cards/).
- Only the primary link's text is announced to screen readers when the Web Component receives focus.
- CSS `focus-within` adds a focus indicator to the component only when its primary link receives keyboard `focus`.
- The rest of the component's content, including any other nested interactive elements, all behave independently.
- Text selection is enabled within the component.

## Required and optional HTML  or `data-` attributes

Attribute | Behaviour
--- | ---
`data-url` | Optional. Identifies the primary link whose URL is used for the click event. Fallback is the first link inside the Web Component.
