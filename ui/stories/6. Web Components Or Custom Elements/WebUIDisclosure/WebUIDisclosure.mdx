- This is functionally equivalent to the [disclosure](/story/components-disclosure-or-show-hide--disclosure) component, with the same accessibility considerations.
- The `data-` attributes that handle the functionality have been subtly renamed.

## TBC
- The JavaScript logic to handle showing/hiding of content is imported from an external shared utility function in `src/javascript/utils/disclosure.ts` to maintain the [DRY code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) approach in this boilerplate.
- This might be refactored, to allow all logic to be contained within the web component itself?
