# `<webui-image-gallery>`
- Uses a simple [grid list layout](/story/layout-grid--grid-list) to arrange the image thumbnails.
- Without JavaScript, clicking thumbnails opens the large images in current browser window.
- With JavaScript, the large images are shown in the [`<webui-modal>`](/docs/web-components-or-custom-elements-webui-modal--docs) Web Component.
- The thumbnail `<a>` elements have been given ARIA `role="button"` and keyboard bindings for `ENTER` and `SPACEBAR` to ensure they behave as buttons.

> Please note: For brevity, the large images only have a subset of the [responsive image](/docs/components-images--docs) `<source>` markup in the `<picture>` element.

<Canvas of={WebUIImageGallery.WebUIImageGallery} />

## TODO
- Consider extending `<webui-modal>` Web Component to enable a single modal instance to be opened by multiple triggers?
- Consider showing the large images in a carousel?
