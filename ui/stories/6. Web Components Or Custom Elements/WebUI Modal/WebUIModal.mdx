<Meta of={WebUIModal} />

# `<webui-modal>`
- This is a JavaScript-based implementation of the [modal](/docs/components-modal--docs) component.
- It still uses the native HTML `<dialog>` element, but opening & closing are handled by JavaScript.

<Canvas of={WebUIModal.WebUIModal} />

## Accessibility considerations
- Keyboard `focus` is currently being set on the `data-content` using `tabindex="-1"` to ensure that content gets announced first, before the `data-close` button.

## Required and optional HTML or `data-` attributes

Attribute | Behaviour
--- | ---
`data-open` | Required. On the button that opens the modal dialog.
`data-close` | Required. On the button(s) that close the modal dialog.
`data-content` | Required. Identifies the modal dialog content.
