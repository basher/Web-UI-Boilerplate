# `<webui-carousel>`
- This is an enhancement of the [default CSS carousel](/story/components-carousel--carousel), with NEXT/PREVIOUS buttons.
- It uses the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) to determine which slide is currently visible.
- There's an optional slide counter, which is updated via a [scrollend event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/scrollend_event) listener. A [polyfill](https://github.com/argyleink/scrollyfills) is included for non-supporting browsers.

## Accessibility considerations
- Keyboard `focus` is modified such that **only visible slides are focusable**.
- The carousel can still be operated by the <kbd>left</kbd> or <kbd>right</kbd> arrow keys, but JavaScript now manages this behaviour.
- An `aria-live` region is used to announce which slide is currently selected in assistive technologies. This region can be optionally shown in the UI by adding the `data-slide-count` attribute to the web component.

## Required and optional HTML  or `data-` attributes

Attribute | Behaviour
--- | ---
`data-slide-count` | Optional. Displays slide count & current slide.
`data-slide-count-pips` | Optional. Displays slide count & current slide as pips instead of text.
