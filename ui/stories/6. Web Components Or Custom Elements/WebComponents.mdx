# HTML Web Components
- The Web Components in this boilerplate are `custom elements` that wrap normal HTML markup, therefore providing a progressive enhancement layer via JavaScript. <sup>1</sup>
- They are **not** empty shells that only work with JavaScript. <sup>2</sup>
- They also don't make use of the [shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM). <sup>3</sup>

> <sup>1</sup>
> Global CSS is inherited by the Web Components because they contain regular HTML markup. Additional CSS scoping & encapsulation is provided by the custom element names, enabling styles not to "leak" out into the global scope.

> <sup>2, 3</sup>
> The [`<webui-ajax-loader>`](/docs/web-components-or-custom-elements-webui-ajax-loader--docs) Web Component is entirely constructed via JavaScript, and uses the shadow DOM.

## Custom elements manifest
- There's an NPM `cem-analyze` script in `package.json` that generates a `./ui/custom-elements.json` file.
- See this [custom elements manifest explainer](https://daverupert.com/2025/10/custom-elements-manifest-killer-feature/) from Dave Rupert.

## Additional reading
- Great explanation by Jeremy Keith (and others) about the power of [HTML Web Components](https://adactio.com/journal/20618).
- Simple example from Chris Ferdinandi showing how to [create a Web Component from scratch](https://gomakethings.com/lets-create-a-web-component-from-scratch/). He also has lots more articles on this topic in his blog.
- Some notes on the recommended use of [connectedCallback() lifecycle method and event listeners](https://hawkticehurst.com/writing/you-are-probably-using-connectedcallback-wrong/).

> NOTES:
> 1. The `<webui-popover>` JavaScript class extends the `<webui-disclosure>` class, so the latter's click event listener has been moved to `connectedCallback()` so that the listener does not have to be declared in both classes.
> 2. See Chris Ferdinandi's explanation about [why this might be necessary](https://gomakethings.com/my-html-web-component-boilerplate-for-2026/#instantiate-in-the-connectedcallback-method).
