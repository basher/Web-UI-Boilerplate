# HTML Web Components
- The Web Components in this boilerplate are `custom elements` that wrap normal HTML markup, therefore providing a progressive enhancement layer via JavaScript.
- They are **not** empty shells that only work with JavaScript. <sup>1</sup>
- They also don't make use of the [shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM). <sup>2</sup>

> <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>
> The [`<webui-ajax-loader>`](/docs/web-components-or-custom-elements-webui-ajax-loader--docs) Web Component is entirely constructed via JavaScript, and uses the shadow DOM.
