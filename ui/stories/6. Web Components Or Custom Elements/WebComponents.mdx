# HTML Web Components
- The Web Components in this boilerplate are simply `custom elements` that wrap normal HTML markup, therefore providing a progressive enhancement layer via JavaScript.
- They are **not** empty shells that only work with JavaScript.
- They also don't make use of the [shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM).

## Additional reading
- Great explanation by Jeremy Keith (and others) about the power of [HTML Web Components](https://adactio.com/journal/20618).
- Simple example from Chris Ferdinandi showing how to [create a Web Component from scratch](https://gomakethings.com/lets-create-a-web-component-from-scratch/). He also has lots more articles on this topic in his blog.
- Some notes on the recommended use of [connectedCallback() lifecycle method and event listeners](https://hawkticehurst.com/writing/you-are-probably-using-connectedcallback-wrong/).
